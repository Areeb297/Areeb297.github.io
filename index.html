                        <p>
                            Hi! I'm Areeb, a passionate data professional, with a background
                            in mathematics, physics, e-busines, and data science, having graduated from Warwick
                            University in 2021. My main dissertation project focused on developing an academic timetabling algorithm using
                            Generative Adversarial Networks and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA-GAN).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During my search for a data science project, I got involved in research with the Warwick Data Science Society concerning
                            applying clustering algorithms to UK Parliament data to identify common parliamentary constituencies based on voting behaviour. 
                            completed a data and AI specialist bootcamp with AiCore where I worked on industry-standard projects, the two main projects being a 
                            data collection pipeline to scrape product data from Amazon and a search ranking system which gave relevant product category output after assessing
                            probablities from the image and text data input using a multi-modal neural network. 
                            Last but not least, I completed a data science fellowship with
                            fellowship.ai where in a team based setting, I tackled the problem of generating image masks from bi-temporal images which were taken pre and post 
                            disaster using Siamese Networks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In my free time, I like to keep up to date with the lastest AI developments such as LLMs, prompt engineering, and applications of AI in healthcare in modern times.
                            Apart from work and studies, I do love photography, playing table tennis and fifa where I do get extremely competitive in the last two.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Fun Fact! I presented my dissertation research in the OR63 conference!

                        A demonstration of my specialism project in the AiCore using a Gif image where the model returns probabilities when
                        an image of any project or a text description or both are entered on the FastAPI server. This project fine-tuned a ResNET50 and implemented
                        a pre-trained BERT model.
